# About

This project is collection of example implementation of several design patterns.
Currently there are example implementation for following design patterns from GoF:

- [observer (listener)](dpobserver/README.md)
- [facade](dpfacade/README.md)
- [adapter](dpadapter/README.md)
- [command](dpcommand/README.md)

Additionally there are also other design patterns which don't belong to GoF

- [servant](dpservant/README.md)

# Class diagrams
Class diagrams which are part of each design pattern are created through [online puml editor](https://www.planttext.com/).
Class diagrams are then exported to png output which is available at URI which is used in design pattern README.md
 files. Source code for PUML (Plant UML) files is part of each module and has name __class.puml__
