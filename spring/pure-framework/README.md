 before and after initialization
* [bean templates](bean.template/README.md) - define parent templates which contains configuration data for child
 beans (e. g. default values of some properties). Example is done via annotation and also via spring XML configuration.
* [dependency injection](di/README.md) - dependency injection through XML and JAVA annotations
* [collections](collections/README.md) - demonstrate how it is possible to set collections of data (map, list, set
) via XML configuration.
* [custom events](custom-event/README.md) - custom events in spring framework
* [aspectJ](aspectj/README.md)
* [profiles](profile/README.md)
* [property source](property-source/README.md) - how to define source of properties.
* [message and i18n](message/README.md)
* [bean validation](bean-validation/README.md)
* [util xml schema](util.xml.schema/README.md)
